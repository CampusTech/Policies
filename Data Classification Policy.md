# Campuswire Data Classification Policy

## Abstract
All application-generated data on Campuswire is classified into one of three types: `Private Data`, `Network Data` and `Generic Usage Data`.

## Private Data
Private Data is user-generated content that is intended for a specific recipient or explicitly defined groups of recipients. Private Data ownership is shared by its authors and recipients.

Some examples of Private Data are:

- Posts created in private classes
- Messages sent in direct messages
- Messages sent in private channels

We never share Private Data with third parties in any form, for any reason.

## Network Data
Network Data is user-generated content that is accessible to everyone within a university network with a Campuswire account. Network Data is owned by its authors.

Some examples of Network Data are:

- Display names of Campuswire users within a university (Directory Information)
- Name of a class on Campuswire
- Posts created within public Classes

We never share Network Data with third parties in any form, for any reason.

## Generic Usage Data
Generic Usage Data is information gathered implicitly from aggregated user behavior. Generic Usage Data plays an important role in helping us provide and improve the Campuswire service, and is owned by CampusTech, Inc.

Some examples of Generic Usage Data are:

- “Students at university X spent an average of Y hours on Campuswire today”
- “Students in classes with more than X classmates ask Y% more questions than...”
- “Professors teaching STEM classes have longer responses to student questions than...”

## Data Access and Deletion Requests
Data owners may request an export of their data, or that their data is deleted. We will do our best to triage and grant such requests in a timely fashion. If you have a Data access or deletion request, email privacy@campuswire.com.
